# RAG Module: Take a Chance!

Welcome to my RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) module! Honestly, I'm writing this README while my memory of this project is quite hazy. But don't worry, we'll explore its mysteries together!

## Description

If I remember correctly, this module is designed to... well, I'm not quite sure. Maybe it's used to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by retrieving information from external sources? Or perhaps it's a tool for generating context-aware responses? Or maybe it's a complex puzzle game?

Anyway, let's find out together!

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the dependencies. Follow these steps:

1.  **Create conda environment**:

    ```bash
    conda create -n rag-env python=3.10
    conda activate rag-env
    ```

2.  **Install Python packages**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

I don't remember exactly how to use this module. But I believe you can find examples and instructions in the `examples/` or `docs/` directory. If not, try running the Python files in the root directory and see what happens!
Try running storing.py file?

## Notes

* Remember, this is a "take a chance" project. Results may not be as expected.
* If you find any useful information, please update this README to help others!
* If you discover a dark secret, keep it to yourself.
